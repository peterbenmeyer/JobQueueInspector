Job Queue Inspector
===================
It looks like James Montalvo began the code for this project on April 5, 2019.  A chart is already running.

This extension addresses an interest in having an extension to MediaWiki that would display specifics on the jobs in the queue.  I am interested to use it, for a Cargo-intensive MediaWiki site where many jobs are running at the same time.  I initiate some and I don't know what others are running and I don't have a good understanding of how long they'll take or whether I've overloaded the system.   -- peterbenmeyer, aka user:econterms
